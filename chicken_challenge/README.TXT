# Chicken Challenge Game.
## Written in Java for Greenfoot by Matthew Schroyer and Elizabeth Haase.

Which crossed first, the chicken or the egg? Wait, that's not quite right...

In Chicken Challenge, you control a chicken trying to cross a 6-lane highway. Use the arrow keys to navigate your chicken safely across.

But get the best score, you must grab eggs that appear on the road as well, before they are splattered by cars. Don't get splattered yourself!

You have three lives to attempt this daring feet. Each time a chicken crosses the road, the player gets 50 points. Each egg saved is 500 points. And each step forward is 10 points.

So you see, it's not so simple as just crossing the road!
